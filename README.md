# Vehicle Data Time-Series Analysis

This repository contains Python code for transforming the provided record-level dataset into a time-series model. The primary objective of this model is to uncover temporal patterns in vehicle listings, with a focus on conducting inventory analysis over time, segmented by regions.

## Overview

The time-series analysis is designed to help users gain insights into regional demand-supply dynamics, seasonal trends, and other relevant patterns in the vehicle market. The model facilitates the creation of time-series charts representing the number of available vehicles over time, allowing users to filter the data based on specific criteria such as region, vehicle type, etc.
